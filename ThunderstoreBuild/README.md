# Friendly Duck 🐤

This mod makes the duck in **R.E.P.O.** friendly! No more surprise attacks — just cute jumps when you grab it.

## Features

- **Left click (grab)** – Makes the duck do its signature **AnnoyingJump™**  
- **Press `E` while holding** – The duck shows some *love* (you’ll know it when you see it 💖)

> Note: The duck no longer hurts you, despawns, or gets stunned. It’s here for vibes.

## Installation

Use **Thunderstore Mod Manager**, or install manually by placing the DLL into your **BepInEx `plugins` folder**.
